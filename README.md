# file_cleaner-v1-v1
Welcome to my first github Repository! A simple menu system allows you to clean all the file names in a specified folder using custom and consistent naming conventions. This is a project with the intention of learning the basics of Regexp while building something useful. As I am not a professional developer, please test the program on copies of files before using on many files to prevent a headache in the case of an undiscovered bug.
